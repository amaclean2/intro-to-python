### Writing Your First Program

Python is extremely simple to get started, but first we're going to get introduced to a couple applications.

On your computer, there's an application called terminal. Terminal is a command line editor for your computer. Everything you can do on your computer, you can do in terminal. You just have to learn the commands for what you want to do. We'll start with a couple simple ones first. A side note, when you're talking in computer science, folders are called directories, so that's what we'll refer to them as.

```
    cd     - "change directory" lets you navigate between directories on your computer
    ls     - "list" lists all the contents of the directory you're currently in
    python - runs whatever the next word is in Python
```
