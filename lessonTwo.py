# There is a math operator, mod (%) that gives you the remainder of a division
# operation.
# Ex: 
# 3 % 2 = 1
# 5 % 3 = 2

# We can use this to identify if a number is even or odd by checking if a number % 2 is 1 or 0

# if a % 2 == 1 :
#   a is odd
# if a % 2 == 0 :
#   a is even


# This exercise will be to write a program that prints all the even
# numbers from 0 to 10
# Use the mod operator and if-else statements to determine if a number is even or odd

i = 0
while i <= 10 :
    # your code here

    i += 1
